2. HTML Template:
You need to create an HTML file that will act as the web page for your Flask app. 
Create a folder named templates in the same directory as your app.py file, and inside that folder, create a file named index.html.

The Flask app now renders the index.html page when the user visits the home route (/).
The form submits the values for TV, Radio, and Newspaper spend to the /predict route using a POST request.
After the model predicts the sales, the result is rendered on the same HTML page inside a Bootstrap-styled success alert.

Running the Application:
Save the app.py and the index.html file in the correct directory structure (templates/index.html).
